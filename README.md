#  BetterRest

Using this app, you can use predict the best hour to go to sleep.

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

The app uses a Machine Learning model to predict the time based on:

- When you want to wake up
- Desired amount of sleep
- Daily coffee intake

I use the Core ML to create and train a Machine Learning model 

I learned how to:

- Create a layout in Swift UI
- Manipulate the State and render layout elements
- Use Stepper, DatePicker, DateFormatter
- Work with dates in Swift
- Train a model with Create ML
- Connect SwiftUI to Core ML

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
